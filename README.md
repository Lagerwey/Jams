# JAMS

Just Another Music Streamer that uses Roon and the Roon API to show and control the music.

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
I started this project to learn REACT and Next.js.
It runs on an old NUC with an intel core i3 and a 1280x400 waveshare screen mounted in a box.

It is a work in progress!!!  



## Getting Started
clone the project and  run the development server:
```bash

npm  run  dev
# or
npm  run  start

# or

yarn  dev

# or

pnpm  dev

```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
