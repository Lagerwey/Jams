The result includes:
    - a URL ("url") for a flac file that is played back using http streaming (add ?src=alexa to this URL during testing), 
      for example https://apps.radioparadise.com/blocks/chan/0/4/1682119-1682123.flac?src=alex
    - the value end_event, which is used to build the next API query, and length, the play time (in sec) of that block
    - an array of song metadata for the songs included in that block of programming
    - for each song, the elapsed time (in ms - from the beginning of the block) when that song begins.

Workflow:
    - The player would start the file & display the metadata for song[0].
    - After song[0]['elapsed'] ms, the display would change to song[1], etc.
    - As the elapsed time on the block file gets close to the end, the data for the next block is loaded via this call: 
      https://api.radioparadise.com/api/get_block?bitrate=4&info=true&event={$end_event}
    - The URL for the next block is then enqueued to start immediately after the current block ends. That start should trigger 
      the next metadata update.
    - At any point during playback, the following call will retrieve a block starting with the next song on our playlist ('skip' 
      function). https://api.radioparadise.com/api/get_block?bitrate=4&info=true&event={$event}&elapsed={elapsed time in sec 
      for block file}
